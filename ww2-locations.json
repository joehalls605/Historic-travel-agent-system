Codenamed Operation Neptune and often referred to as D-Day, it was the largest seaborne invasion in history. The operation began the liberation of France (and later western Europe) and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western Front. Planning for the operation began in 1943. In the months leading up to the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial military deception, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. The beaches are divided into five sectors: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword."

It consisted of Auschwitz I (the main camp), Auschwitz II–Birkenau (a combination concentration/extermination camp), Auschwitz III–Monowitz (a labor camp to staff an IG Farben factory), and 45 satellite camps. Auschwitz I was first constructed to hold Polish political prisoners, who began to arrive in May 1940. The first extermination of prisoners took place in September 1941. Auschwitz II–Birkenau went on to become a major site of the Nazi 'Final Solution to the Jewish question'. From early 1942 until late 1944, transport trains delivered Jews to the camp's gas chambers from all over German-occupied Europe. More than 1.1 million people, around 90 percent of them Jewish, died at Auschwitz. The memorial and museum now stand as a solemn reminder of the atrocities committed during the Holocaust."

Just before 8 a.m. on that Sunday morning, hundreds of Japanese fighter planes descended on the base, where they managed to destroy or damage nearly 20 American naval vessels, including eight battleships, and over 300 airplanes. More than 2,400 Americans died in the attack, including civilians, and another 1,000 people were wounded. The day after the assault, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked Congress to declare war on Japan, which they approved. The Pearl Harbor Memorial features several sites, including the USS Arizona Memorial, which marks the resting place of 1,102 sailors and Marines killed on the USS Arizona during the attack. The memorial, built in 1962, straddles the sunken hull of the battleship without touching it."

The Peace Memorial Park, which surrounds the museum and cenotaph, was built on an open field that was created by the explosion. Today, the memorial park is visited by more than one million people each year, and the museum displays artifacts and stories from the bombing, focusing on the devastating human cost of nuclear weapons and advocating for world peace."

After its completion in 1999, it once again became the meeting place of the German parliament: the modern Bundestag. The Reichstag dome, designed by architect Norman Foster, is a glass dome constructed on top of the rebuilt Reichstag building. It features a mirrored cone in the center that directs sunlight into the building and allows visitors to view the parliamentary proceedings from the dome. The dome symbolizes the reunification of Germany and the transparency of the democratic process."

The evacuation was ordered on May 26, and a hastily assembled fleet of over 800 boats, including military vessels and civilian craft such as fishing boats and pleasure cruisers (later known as the 'Little Ships of Dunkirk'), sailed across the English Channel to rescue the stranded soldiers. Despite the German air superiority, the Royal Air Force conducted operations to protect the evacuation. In the end, 338,226 soldiers were rescued by a hastily assembled fleet of over 800 vessels. The event is seen as a pivotal moment in World War II and has been immortalized in films, books, and memorials."

The mansion was constructed during the 1870s for the English financier and politician Sir Herbert Samuel Leon. During World War II, the estate housed the British government's Code and Cypher School, which worked on breaking the German Enigma and other codes. The team at Bletchley Park, including Alan Turing, developed the Bombe, an electromechanical device used to help break Enigma-enciphered messages. The intelligence produced at Bletchley Park, codenamed Ultra, provided crucial assistance to the Allied war effort and is credited with shortening the war by two to four years. The site is now a museum and heritage attraction, open to the public, featuring exhibitions about the codebreaking operations and the people who worked there."

The American invasion, designated Operation Detachment, had the goal of capturing the entire island, including the three Japanese-controlled airfields, to provide a staging area for attacks on the Japanese main islands. This five-week battle comprised some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting of the Pacific War. The battle was immortalized by Joe Rosenthal's photograph of the raising of the U.S. flag on top of the 169 m (554 ft) Mount Suribachi by six U.S. Marines, which became an iconic image of the war. Of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima at the beginning of the battle, only 216 were taken prisoner, with the rest being killed or missing. After the war, the island was administered by the United States until 1968, when it was returned to Japan."

It focuses on the Battle of the Bulge, which was fought around the town of Bastogne in December 1944 and January 1945. The Battle of the Bulge was the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front during World War II. It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region of Wallonia in eastern Belgium, northeast France, and Luxembourg. The surprise attack caught the Allied forces completely off guard. American forces bore the brunt of the attack and incurred their highest casualties of any operation during the war. The battle also severely depleted Germany's armored forces, and they were largely unable to replace them. German personnel and, later, Luftwaffe aircraft (during the Unternehmen Bodenplatte) also sustained heavy losses. The museum uses modern scenography techniques and features numerous artifacts, testimonials, and multi-sensory exhibits to immerse visitors in the history of the battle and the broader context of World War II."
